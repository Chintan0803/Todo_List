   - The backend API handles creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks in the database.

4. **Real-time Updates**:
   - When users add, edit, or delete tasks, the changes are immediately reflected in the user interface.
   - The frontend communicates with the backend API to ensure that all changes are saved and retrieved from the database.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - The application includes error handling to manage issues such as network errors or invalid inputs.
   - Users receive feedback when actions are successful or if there are any issues.

6. **Performance**:
